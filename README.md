# howler.js-master-app
[howler.js](https://howlerjs.com) is an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) and falls back to [HTML5 Audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-audio-element). This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.
